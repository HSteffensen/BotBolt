## Acquire Currency
### The drop system
Money will drop in channels where the Bot Owner has activated it (for Tazem, this is every channel except #mod-chat as of June 1, 2017).  
Money drops with a fixed chance for every message sent in these channels. There are three tiers of drops. Each tier is less likely but gives more money.  

On channels with "low" verbosity, a message will pop up once the money pile hits a threshold (20 by default). Large enough drops might stay hidden though :P  
On channels with "medium" or "high" verbosity, a message will pop up for every drop, even the large ones.

Don't have many good ideas in this category.

### Moneymaking Strategy
Type `!grab` in a channel when a message pops up. Most channels on Tazem have low verbosity, so you'll see a message once it's big enough to actually matter. The `!grab` command has a 1 hour cooldown, so using it on random channels isn't actually great.

Grabbing money will not get you the whole pile, unless it is small.

#### Anti-spam
There are measures in place to prevent rapid or repeated messages from having any chance to drop money. They should not get in the way of normal conversation, but let me know if they do.
