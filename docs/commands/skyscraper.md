# Skyscraper
Hire workers and build the highest skyscraper. Sabotage other peoples' work if theirs is taller than yours.

Check skyscraper height: leave blank to see your own, or mention someone else to see theirs.  
`!skyscraper`  
`!skyscraper @BotBolt`

See the leaderboard: say leaderboard or lb, optionally add a page number  
Pages are up to 10 listings.  
`!skyscraper leaderboard` to show the top 10  
`!skyscraper lb 2` to show #11-20

Hire workers: say hire and a number  
Each worker costs $1 more than the last.  
`!skyscraper hire 1`

Sabotage an enemy: say sabotage and mention them  
Sabotage takes out 10% of their workers and costs as much as their most expensive worker.  
`!skyscraper sabotage @BotBolt`

Get an enemy's workers to strike: say strike, a number of hours, and mention them  
Strike halves their building speed. Costs as much as your most expensive worker, but each extra hour costs $1 more than the last.  
`!skyscraper strike 1 @BotBolt`

Cause an earthquake: say earthquake and the magnitude  
Magnitude 1 costs $1, and each magnitude up costs 2x as much. Everyone's buildings will be damaged proportional to their height, including your own.  
`!skyscraper earthquake 1`
